# Contribution Guidlines

The best way to ask for help or propose a new idea is to [create a new issue](https://github.com/XavierBrassoud/Arduino_Epson_PNL_CE02/issues/new) while creating a Pull Request with your code changes allows you to share your own innovations with the rest of the community.

The following are some guidelines to observe when creating issues or PRs:

- Be friendly; it is important that we can all enjoy a safe space as we are all working on the same project and it is okay for people to have different ideas

- [Use code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code); it helps us help you when we can read your code! On that note also refrain from pasting more than 30 lines of code in a post, instead [create a gist](https://gist.github.com/) if you need to share large snippets

- Titles follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (eg. *feat: My Awesome Feature*, *fix(topic): Something bad*)

- Be detailed; refrain from mentioning code problems without sharing your source code and always give information regarding your board and version of the library

- Ensure your code are properly formed with `clang-format` and passes quality gates with `pio checks`

- Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) [extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) is highly recommended
